<details>
  <summary>More details on that</summary>
You can have some NSFW content on the server, as long as it is gated from other content and it asks for your age first (or other measures). This is something I have to require because in my country and in many other countries too, linking minors to porn is illegal. I cannot verify the age of my visitors, nor does Revolt. So I don't want to go into any legal risks here - as this is a serious felony. 
Now you might ask: Why is Google linking porn-sites then without age check? They have the "Provider privilege" (known in German law) in US law there is something similar, I guess Section 230. 
The difference is: We currently approve every submission and thus we cannot make use of Sec 230 / Provider privilege. Google and other sites don't approve the content seen. However this policy might change depending on the legal situation and development of Revolt.
